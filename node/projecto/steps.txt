1 - npm init -y

2 - npm i --save express@4.16.2 -E

3 - create a folder "src"

4 - create a file "server.js" inside "src" we configure express where we have all 
configuration of our server

5 - after filing the file with code, you can run it using ctrl + option + N or you can go to terminal
and go to folder src like this: node src/server.js, it will execute on terminal and show that the port 
is in use. you can cancel the execution on output by clicking ctrl + option + M.

6 - go to file "package.json", change the main field to the server file: "src/server.js"
change also the script, add: "start": "nodemon",
if you want to install inside the project just: npm i --save nodemon, but
we use nodemon on a dev version, so use this:
npm i --save-dev nodemon@2.0.16 -E

7 - now you can run npm start. It will start node by going to the server.js that we configured on package.json

8 - now you can test it on POSTMAN by puttin this on the url, using get method: http://localhost:3003/produtos

9 - after configuration of dataBase.js file, you go to POSTMAN and use this conf:
Post, uxe: x-www-form-urlencoded, then input nome and preco.
it generates an error, and to correct it we need to follow step 10.

10 - npm -i --save body-parser@1.18.2 -E,
than import this to server.js file, const bodyParser = require('body-parser'),
than add this on server.js file, app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}))
so that the body parser treats all the requisitions using the urlencoded
